## Websites I Recommend
* [Dropout](https://www.dropout.tv/browse)
  * An independent video subscription service. I enjoy seeing the passion for improv comedy lifted up and displayed in such diverse, awesome people.

  * A detailed map of Wildemount. I play in a D&D campaign that's set in Wildemount, so I like having this map on hand for easy reference. WorldAnvil has many high quality maps like this one for different areas.
